# Setting up the Notebook Manually

To set up the notebook manually, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed.**  You can check your Python version by running `python --version` in your terminal.  If you don't have Python 3.9 or higher, please install it before proceeding.

2. **Install Jupyter (Lab or Notebook):**
   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab

This command installs JupyterLab, which provides a more feature-rich environment. If you prefer the classic Jupyter Notebook interface, you can install it using pip install notebook.
 * Clone the repository:
   git clone [https://github.com/aimtyaem/CFP-csv-datasets-.git](https://github.com/aimtyaem/CFP-csv-datasets-.git)

   This command clones the repository containing the notebook and associated files to your local machine.
 * Navigate to the cloned directory:
   cd CFP-csv-datasets-

   This command changes your current directory in the terminal to the newly cloned repository folder.
 * Open the Jupyter notebook:
   jupyter lab

   or
   jupyter notebook

   This command launches JupyterLab (or Jupyter Notebook) in your web browser.
 * In Jupyter Lab (or Notebook), open the coefficients.ipynb file and run all cells.  Once Jupyter is open, you should see the coefficients.ipynb file in the file browser. Open it, and then execute all cells in the notebook to run the code and generate the results.  You can typically run all cells by going to the "Run" menu and selecting "Run All Cells".
