## Expanded Applications of Autosmallsatellites

### 1. **Deep Space Missions**
   - **MarCO (Mars Cube One)**:
     - Two CubeSats launched with NASA’s InSight lander in 2018.
     - Demonstrated autonomous operations in deep space, including data relay and navigation.
     - Future applications: Autonomous exploration, asteroid monitoring, and lunar missions.

### 2. **Earth Observation & Environmental Monitoring**
   - **Climate and Pollution Tracking**:
     - Use autonomous algorithms for hyperspectral imaging to monitor environmental changes like deforestation or ocean health.
     - Example: Planet Labs’ Dove satellites could autonomously adjust imaging parameters based on detected changes.
   - **Disaster Response**:
     - Autosmallsatellites can autonomously deploy to observe and report on natural disasters like wildfires or hurricanes.

### 3. **Atmospheric and Space Science**
   - **Ionospheric Studies**:
     - Autosmallsatellites like NASA’s Dellingr autonomously measure plasma density and magnetic fields.
   - **Solar Wind Analysis**:
     - Autonomous control of instruments to adjust for solar activity, enhancing data collection.

### 4. **Technology Demonstration**
   - **3Cat-1 (Polytechnic University of Catalonia)**:
     - Launched in 2018, showcasing autonomous operations with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components.
     - Key experiments:
       - **Autonomous MEMS Oxygen Sensor**: Self-adjusting for optimal atmospheric analysis.
       - **Wireless Power Transfer**: Autonomous energy management between components.
       - **Thermal Gradient Energy Harvesting**: Self-regulating power generation from temperature differences.

### 5. **Communications & IoT Connectivity**
   - **Swarm Technologies’ Constellation**:
     - 0.25U CubeSats autonomously manage low-bandwidth IoT connections for various sectors.
   - **Satellite Internet**:
     - Although primarily larger satellites, the concept extends to autosmallsatellites for more localized or specialized internet services.
